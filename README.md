# Titanic_data_analysis
The Disaster: "TITANIC" which was sunk in 1912 ,
Many childrens teenagers and adults was reported dead in this Disaster.
I have just analysed the data set of titanic who was survived or not, 
And, i created a Logistic regression Model to predict the person was survived or not,
Due to short amount of data i.e.812 case. my model performance was 80%.
You can go through the pdf which i have mentioned in the code section so that you dont have to open and download the python codes . 
You can clearly understand by the pdf only.
